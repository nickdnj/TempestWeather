Overview
The D3marco platform is a web-based application designed to provide access to various AI utilities. The platform is built using Python 3.11, Django, and integrates with GitHub for version control and deployment to Google Cloud. The platform includes user authentication with self-registration and email verification.

   * plugins/plugin_manager.py
      * Manages plugins by dynamically loading and initializing them.
      * Loads specific plugins like `PDFScribePlugin` and `SampleAppPlugin`.
   * plugins/pdfscribe_plugin.py
      * A plugin implementing `PluginInterface`.
      * Provides views for uploading and processing PDF files.
      * Integrates with OpenAI API for text extraction from images.
   * plugins/sample_plugin.py
      * A sample plugin implementing `PluginInterface`.
      * Provides a sample view and routes.
   * plugins/views.py
      * Contains views for plugins.
4. Static Files and Templates
   * static/css/
      * Directory for static CSS files.
   * templates/home.html
      * The home page template displayed to logged-in users.

Functional Requirements
1. User Authentication
   * Users can register for an account.
   * Users receive an email with an activation link to verify their account.
   * Users can log in and log out.
   * Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page.
2. Plugin Management
   * Plugins are dynamically loaded at runtime.
   * Plugins can define their own routes and views.
   * Plugins can add menu items to the platform.
3. Email Configuration
   * The platform sends an email for account activation.
   * Uses SMTP configuration provided in settings.py.
Security Measures
* Use of HTTPS in production for secure communication.
* Passwords are encrypted using Django's built-in password hashing.
* User roles and permissions managed through Django's authentication system.
* Measures implemented to protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.
Scalability
* The codebase is prepared for future integration with a scalable database solution.
* Load balancing and horizontal scaling considerations for future development.
Extensibility
* The plugin system is designed to allow easy addition of new plugins.
* Future plugins could include analytics tools, third-party integrations, and custom AI models.
Documentation
* Code comments and docstrings are included for major functions and classes.
* A step-by-step setup guide is provided for developers.
* User documentation includes a user guide and FAQ/help center.
Deployment
